# S3



## S3 Replication



- Cross region replication

- Same region replication 

- Buckets can be in different accounts 

- Copying is asynchronous

- Proper IAM permissions to S3

  

### Hands on

- Bucket versioning is required
- Replication rule under bucket management tab 
- Will only replicate newer objects after creating rule 
- Delete markers not replicated by default
