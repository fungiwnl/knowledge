# Knowledge

This is my personal wiki hosted using [Gitbook](https://wiki.b-fung.com/), where I document things that I've learnt to use as future reference, so I don't have to re-google stuff I've learnt and forgotten, while also reinforcing the things I've learnt along the way.

Currently, this is just mostly just an AWS study note dumping ground as I work towards an AWS Solutions Architect Creditation.
